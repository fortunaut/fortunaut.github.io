    <h3>Support the Site</h3>
    <p>
      Do you value the content on this site? Want to support me as I find out what plants grow well in foggy San Francisco without
      commiting to buying something off of the JasoClayCo storefront?
    </p>
    <p>
      While the site itself doesn't have any costs, gardening supplies certainly do. You're welcome to drop off
      extra supplies or seeds if there's something specific you'd like me to try and write about.
    </p>
